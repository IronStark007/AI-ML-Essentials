Machine Learning is the part of AI and is the process of training the machine with training data to make predictions. It is divided into three types

1. Supervised Learning - In this process the machine is trained on labelled data.
2. UnSuperVise Learning - In this process the machine is trained on unlabelled data.
3. Semi Supervised Learning - In this data is having both labelled and unlabelled data.
4. Reinforest Learning - In this process the machine is trained to make a sequence of decision .It is based on the idea of trials and errors.
